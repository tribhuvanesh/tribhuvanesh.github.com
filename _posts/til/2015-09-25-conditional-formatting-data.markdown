My workflow usually involves iterations of models, with their results stacked sequentially.
I found a fun way of color-coding these results.
It makes the numbers so much easier to navigate and interpret.

I do this in Google Docs by `Selecting cells | Format | Conditional Formatting`.
This is possible in Libre Office too! (Although it involves some struggle to make it
  look as good.)
