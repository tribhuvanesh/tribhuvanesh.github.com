I'm Tribhuvanesh, a second year Computer Science Master's student at
[ETH Zürich](http://inf.ethz.ch/).
Of late, I've been working in an interdisciplinary domain involving Machine Learning,
Computer Vision and Distributed Systems.
Specifically, distributed optimization of large margin structured prediction
classifiers.
I'm currently being co-advised for my thesis by [Martin Jaggi](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/jaggim/), [Aurelien Lucchi](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/alucchi/) and [Thomas Hofmann](http://da.inf.ethz.ch/people/ThomasHofmann/) in the
[Data Analytics Lab](http://da.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH.  

<br />

Let me just get it out there -- I love Machine Learning.
One day, I want to wake up to sentient machines, with opposable thumbs and all.
Not for our hedonistic pleasures, but rather so that we can aim for and embark on
higher endeavours.
Although being pranked, and falling backward into a cryogenic tube and being
frozen for 1000 years is [one way](http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Philip_J._Fry);
I much prefer making any meaningful contribution,
however tiny, to help us inch there.
I maybe a sort of dilettante skeptic claiming that we are inching there, contradicting
the progress made by current booming research in this field.
But, we are so far away! Andrej Karpathy expresses this nicely in his
[post](http://karpathy.github.io/2012/10/22/state-of-computer-vision/).

<br />

When I'm not spending computational time crunching data, I love to hack and develop
solutions to everyday problems (often made-up).
I sometimes use hackathons as an outlet for scratching this itch; I have already
won a few, including Mashery Prize for [Snipbase](http://challengepost.com/software/snipbase)
at [PennApps X](http://pennappsx.challengepost.com/) and cut it close some other times, like with
[what-i-cook-up](https://medium.com/pennapps-spring-2014/pennapps-finalists-1d0dd66dc57c).  

<br />

Apart from this, I also love to travel, experience and learn from new cultures
or escape from reality by hiking into the wilderness.
Once a painter by a nice landscape told my friend - closely observing, looking for
details and documenting it lets the experience stay longer within.
This resonates with me.
While I'd love to pick up painting skills in order to do this,
I'm often on tightly packed schedules and need to keep moving.
As a compromise, I try to compress the atmosphere and experiences at these places
and squeeze it into the photographs, which I capture with a
[fancy toy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D7100).

A bit about my past -- I previously worked with the
[Associates Platform](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/) team at
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/).
Shortly before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore.
