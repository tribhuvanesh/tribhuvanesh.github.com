Welcome to Constrained Ramblings!

I'm Tribhuvanesh, a Computer Science Master's student at

Presently, I'm a research intern at Xerox Research Center Europe supervised by Diane Larlus and Albert Gordo.
We are working on advancing deep learning techniques to solve some really interesting and challenging problems in Computer Vision.
