Welcome to Constrained Ramblings!

<br />

I'm Tribhuvanesh, a second year Computer Science Master's student at
[ETH ZÃ¼rich](http://inf.ethz.ch/).
Of late, I've been working in an interdisciplinary domain involving Machine Learning,
Computer Vision and Distributed Systems.
Specifically, distributed optimization of large margin structured prediction
classifiers.
I'm currently being co-advised for my thesis by [Martin Jaggi](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/jaggim/), [Aurelien Lucchi](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/alucchi/) and [Thomas Hofmann](http://da.inf.ethz.ch/people/ThomasHofmann/) in the
[Data Analytics Lab](http://da.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH.
